title: Cognitive Workload & MI-BCI
---

Towards understanding the effect of user’s cognitive state on BCI performance

<!--more-->

### Abstract
This ongoing project aims at assessing participants’ cognitive load during MI-BCI training using different
measures (e.g. subjective questionnaires, EEG, reaction times) and its relationship on learning
evolution during the session.
We will recruit around 20 participants that will participate in three MI-BCI training sessions, each on
a different day, lasting 2 hours each. First, we will assess participant’s working memory
abilities with the number span task from the Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV,
1955). Also users will be asked to fill in different psychometric tests, during the sessions, to
assess their cognitive states. During the session they will be equipped with an EEG cap in
order to control the system with mental imagery (i.e. MI-BCI training). In order to monitor a
subject's workload during the training, participants will first complete a passive BCI task. Our
hypothesis is that cognitive load will vary during the training and will be linked with learning performances. We predict that the task design will have an effect on the participant’s cognitive load and learning performances.
